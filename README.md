## Getting Started
**Group 8** are the designers and builders of the server room, the temple where the brain of a high-tech artificial intelligence called **"STASIS"** is located and all the equipment necessary to keep it running.

Our responsibilities are: 

* The manufacture of the technical equipment that allows STASIS to remain in operation, through the use of state-of-the-art materials and technologies.

* The design and implementation of complex algorithms to prevent access to STASIS source code and the two wires that allow it to be shut down directly and "casually" open all the doors leading to a safe and direct exit from the high-security complex.

### Team
* Cristina Maurette
* Konstantin Kuliabin
* Claudio Ray 

### Work done and on-going
- [x] Discuss and define server room theme
- [x] Every one ready on slack
- [ ] Puzzles!
